# Mandelbrot in JavaScript

## todo

- better readme (LOL)
- highlight section of the image to render a new zoom level
- (how?) auto-zoom?
- better algorithm - look at [Advanced_plotting_algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set#Advanced_plotting_algorithms) - border tracing looks neat
- better threading - look into re-using threads somehow
